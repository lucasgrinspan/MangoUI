  <h1>Miami Mangos</h1>
  <p>
    Growing up, I had a mango tree. So did some of my friends. Late summer rained endless mangos
    onto my backyard and mango vendors would line some of the roads nearby. A visit to a friend's
    house could start with abuela's mango smoothie and end with mango smiles.

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>
    MangoUI started as an experiment to transfer these experiences to a website. The colors are
    lifted directly from the fruit. Controls depress slightly when clicked, similar to pressing a
    ripe mango. The fonts, icons, and components are designed to only be round.
