<h1>Components</h1>
<p>
  Component styles are provided through the <code>mango.css</code> file, using minimal class names to enforce semantic
  HTML. Across the Internet, a common accessibility issue is that the visuals of a component don't match the semantics.
  For example, some
  component libraries expose a <code>.selected</code> class that will style a component in the selected state.
  Developers will apply that class without updating the semantics in the HTML as well
  (<code>aria-selected="true"</code>). Screen readers can't perceive the different classes applied and are now unable to
  properly use the component.
</p>
<p>
  The strength of Mango UI is that it tightly couples the styling with the semantics. Instead of using a
  <code>.selected</code> class, the stylesheet takes advantage of CSS selectors to target components with the relevant
  ARIA attributes. For example, to style an active nav link, use <code>&lt;a aria-current="true" /&gt;</code> or to
  style a menu button, use <code>&lt;button aria-haspopup="menu" /&gt;</code>. No other class names are required!
</p>
<p>
  In each component page, the selectors required are listed at the start to show the expected markup or you can inspect
  the example boxes, which are always shown in a slightly darker background, like so:
</p>
<div class="card example shrink">
  <details>
    <summary>How can you tell if a tree is a dogwood tree?</summary>
    By the bark.
  </details>
</div>
<p>
  Some components use JavaScript to handle things like focus management and ARIA attributes. If so, the page will
  indicate that you have to include the <code>mango.js</code> file as well. If desired, you can also use your own
  implementation as long as you follow the ARIA semantics. None of the styles are ever provided in the
  JavaScript file, making it easy to replace functionality.

    href="https://github.com/lucasgrinspan/MangoUI/tree/main/src/components"><code>src/components</code></a> folder on
  GitHub to see all of the SCSS implementations. The JavaScript is available in the <a
    href="https://github.com/lucasgrinspan/MangoUI/tree/main/src/js"><code>src/js</code></a> directory. Feel free to
  raise any issues or PRs in the repository. Remember, it takes two to mango ðŸ˜„
