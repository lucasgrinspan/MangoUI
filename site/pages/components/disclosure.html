    The disclosure (also known as accordion or collapsible) is a native HTML widget that can show
    and hide content when the disclosure button is toggled. The <code>summary</code> should be the
    first child of the <code>details</code> element. Any other elements in the
    <code>details</code> will be the content that gets shown and hidden. They can be used on their
    own or in a group, in which case, surround the disclosures with a
    <code>&lt;div class="dislosure-group" /&gt;</code> to group them visually.
