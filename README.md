# Mango UI

This is a fun little project experimenting with using semantic selectors to build a component library. The idea is simple, instead of using `class="button loading"` to make a loading button, you would use a markup like:

```html
<button>
  <span role="alert">Loading...</span>
</button>
```

This way, the developer is forced to use descriptive HTML and the styles applied to each component will match the semantics.

On top of this, I wanted to practice web design and creating a cohesive design skills. Using the colors of a mango as inspiration, I created a few themes.
