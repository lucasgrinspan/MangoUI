<div class="section">
  <h1>Anchor</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>Selector</dt>
    <dd><code>a</code></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    The anchor is used to navigate the user to another page. It should not be used to perform
    actions on the page. If you need a minimal button, use
    <code>&lt;button class="ghost"/&gt;</code> instead.
  </p>
  <div class="card row example shrink">
    <a href="#">Home</a> <a href="#">About</a> <a href="#">Shop</a>
  </div>
  <p>
    When using the anchor, make sure to communicate what is being linked to. Don't use labels like
    "Click here" as they increase cognitive load to decipher the target. For visual users, it makes
    it harder to skim through text to find a specific link and for screen reader users, navigating
    by links will be more challenging as the link text gets read out of context.

  <p>
    When possible, use unique link names.

    to click links more easily if they don't have to specify which of the duplicated links they
    meant.

    In general, it is better to avoid using <code>target="_blank"</code> on links to open them in a
    new tab as it changes default expected behavior. Users will choose to open links in a new tab or
    window if they want to.
